    <h2>Do something out of the ordinary</h2>
    <h3>Who we are</h3>
    <p>Years ago, when there was no telly, Nintendo, or even Monopoly, the people of the Fens entertained themselves and
        others by dressing up in strange costumes, hiding their faces, and dancing for money or beer, much to the
        disapproval of civilised people. They called it Molly dancing.</p>
    <p>We have adapted the dances and music for a modern audience but retained the Molly tradition of individuality,
        rebelliousness, bizarre costumes, anonymity, and fun. We perform at small local events and major festivals
        across the country. We are a relaxed amateur group for whom enjoyment, social life, and the well-being of the
        team are as important as dancing and music. We are a mixed gender team and fully inclusive. Although amateurs,
        we set ourselves high standards and are much respected in the world of traditional dance.</p>

    <h3>How to join</h3>
    <p>Come along for a taster session on our practice evenings. It is best if you <a href="contact">contact us</a>
        beforehand, so
        that we can ensure you get our full attention.</p>
    <p>You can join as a dancer. No previous experience is necessary: if you can hop, you can dance!</p>
    <p>You can join as a musician. We have used instruments such as melodeons, drums, saxophones, recorders, violins and
        sousas. Don't feel that you have to be a highly accomplished musician.</p>
    <p>Or you can join as both!</p>
    <h3>Age limit</h3>
    <p>Minors are welcome to join but must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.</p>
    <p>There is no upper age limit except for nature. We have members who dance into their 70s, but inevitably we
        eventually reach an age where we no longer have the speed or agility to keep up and must hang up our dancing
        shoes.</p>
    <h3> When and where we practice</h3>
    <p>We practice monday nights from 8:00pm till 9:30pm at The Fletton Woodston & Stanground Ex-Service & Working
        Mens Club, 243A High St, Peterborough, PE2 9EH.</p>
    <h3>Cost</h3>
    <p>Taster sessions are free and there are no membership fees. When you become a member you will need to join the
        Fletton Club which will cost you less than £20 per year.</p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>Our practice room is fully accessible, but we cannot guarantee that performance venues will be.</p>
